Sun Aug 13 11:44:20 2000  Joern Thyssen  <joern@thyssen.nu>

	* eval.c: New function EvaluatePositionCubeful[1].
	* play.c (ComputerTurn): Double strategy for money play.
	* set.c, show.c: show/set beavers (for money game with or without
	beavers, racoons, and other critters)
	* gnubg.c, database.c, rollout.c: Changes related to the above.

Wed Aug  2 13:29:02 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* eval.c: Create new race net. See race inputs in file.

Tue Aug  1 09:34:50 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (CommandSaveSettings): Add "this file is automatically
	generated" warning at top of output.

	* eval.c (EvaluatePositionFull): Fix bug that would force evaluation
	using old positionclass, even if fRelativeAccuracy was FALSE.

Mon Jul 31 13:27:37 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* xgame.c (RunExt): If BSD FASYNC-style I/O notification is not
	available, use System V SIGPOLL instead.
	
Mon Jul 31 10:49:18 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* rollout.c (Rollout) [USE_GTK]: Added graphical rollout output.

	names and scores.

	* gtkgame.c: Added more menu commands.
	
	* eval.c (DumpBearoff1): Show from the first to the last non-zero
	probability, even if there are zeroes in between.

	* gnubg.c (UpdateSetting): New function.  Anybody that changes the
	global settings (e.g. fConfirm) or game/match state (e.g. nMatchTo)
	should call this function afterwards so that other code can update
	things as necessary -- a sort of minimalist MVC arrangement.

	* gnubg.c (outputnew, outputoff, outputon): New functions.

	* gnubg.c (CommandLoadCommands, CommandSaveSettings): New functions.
	Loading and saving settings is now implemented.

	* gnubg.c: Set fRelativeAccuracy to FALSE in all the default
	evalcontexts (gnubg seems to play better without it).
	
Fri Jul 28 10:08:49 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gtkboard.c (board_pointer, board_edit): More work on board
	editing.

	* gnubg.c (main): Add a `-b' (--no-bearoff) option, to enable
	gnubg to run without the bearoff database.

	* eval.c (ClassifyPosition): Do not classify anything as a bearoff
	position if the bearoff database was not loaded (i.e. use the
	race evaluator).

Thu Jul 27 10:03:33 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gtkboard.c (board_init): Change position ID to an entry field,
	add "set" and "edit" buttons.

Tue Jul 25 10:33:54 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (output, outputl, outputc, outputf, outputv, outputx): New
	functions replacing stdout operations.  They display in the status
	bar or a dialog box when using GTK, or to stdout otherwise.
	Extensive related changes elsewhere.
	
Sat Jul 15 14:28:35 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (GetInputYN): New function.
	* gtkgame.c (GTKGetInputYN): New function.

Fri Jul 14 22:44:45 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gtkgame.c (ShowList): New function, to replace ShowPaged()
	when GTK is in use (for "show copying" and "show warranty" commands).

	* dice.c (PrintRNGSeed): New function, for "show seed" command.

Fri Jul 14 10:12:48 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* md5.c: New file.  Add another dice generator (MD5 hash of the seed).

	* gtkboard.c: Allow clicking on an empty point (or opponent blot) to
	make the point.

Thu Jul 13 09:08:01 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* configure.in: Merged the GTK and Ext ports back together.  Use
	GTK if possible; otherwise use Ext if possible; otherwise use
	plain TTY.  Extensive changes elsewhere to support merge.

	* makebearoff.c (main): use binary mode on stdout, if possible,
	to avoid problems on non-POSIX systems.

Wed Jul 12 10:27:11 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gtkgame.c (HandleXAction): Recursive event handling is now
	implemented again.  More GTK changes.  The GTK port should now
	be more functional than the old X one.

Wed Jul 12 09:14:34 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* eval.c: Added fRelativeAccuracy=TRUE to ecBasic.

Tue Jul 11 13:44:49 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

Mon Jul 10 09:54:48 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gtkboard.c: New file.  Extensive changes elsewhere for GTK port.

Mon Jul 10 09:40:11 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c: Expanded "help" command.

	* set.c (CommandSetDice): Allow dice to be entered without
	space in between.
	
	* play.c (ComputerTurn): Don't add move to game if interrupted.

Wed Jul  5 12:55:35 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (CommandShowGame): More work on saving.
	
	* show.c: Added several missing "show" commands.

	by Eric Augustine).

Mon Jun 19 20:39:36 2000  Oystein Johansen <oeysteij@online.no>

        * rollout.c: Fixed Cygwin bug

        * Makefile.am: Changed the linking order of the X11 libraries
        to make it easyer to compile for Win32/Cygwin

        * /lib/rand_r.h: Don't include the prototype in Cygwin
 
Tue Jun 13 10:47:36 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* show.c (CommandShowThorp): deleted duplicate line.

Mon Jun 12 09:29:30 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	Bug report from Sam Pottle:
	
	* rollout.c (BasicRollout): remove `+1' from dice parameters to
	FindBestMove.

	* kleinman.c: all occurrences of `Kleinmann' renamed to `Kleinman'.

Tue May  9 12:10:58 2000  Joern Thyssen  <joern@thyssen.nu>

	* gnubg.c (main,StdinReadNotify): Chop the newline returned
        from the fgets call, otherwise many 'set' commands won't work
        on machines without libreadline.

Thu May  4 14:05:33 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* eval.c: Changed net inputs. Removed uncontributing ones, added
	2 new ones (I_TIMING and I_BACKBONE). New weights as well. 

Thu May 4 14:25:00 2000  Joern Thyssen  <joern@thyssen.nu>

	* backgammon.h, eval.c, eval.h, set.c, show.c: implementation of
	reduced 2+ ply searches.

Mon Apr 10 14:13:37 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* makeweights.c (main): use binary mode on stdout, if possible,
	to avoid problems on non-POSIX systems.
	* eval.c (EvalInitialise): open gnubg.wd in binary mode, to
 	avoid problems on non-POSIX systems.

Fri Apr  7 09:13:50 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* play.c (ComputerTurn): return a value after abort(), to pacify
	compiler warnings.
	(NextTurn): add parentheses to pacify compiler.

Sat Mar 11 20:10:36 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* eval.c (DumpContact): Show the partial derivates of the
	equity with respect to the inputs shown.

Tue Mar  7 10:06:32 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* xboard.c (BoardPointer): Use PointerMotionHintMask to make sure
	we don't lag behind drawing dragging chequers.

	* eval.c (TrainPosition): Fix stupid syntax error in yesterday's
	change.

Mon Mar  6 10:27:44 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* configure.in: Use $datadir (not $pkgdatadir) to find installation
	path.  $pkgdatadir is an automake invention; configure doesn't know
	about it.

	* eval.c (TrainPosition): Calculate alpha based on the correct net.
	* database.c (CommandDatabaseDump): Fix spelling mistake.

Sun Mar  5 14:56:42 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* eval.c: Disable BPG net until I figure if there is a way to get rid
	of the discontinuities between the two nets. Evaluation is less
	accurate in absolute terms, but generates less incorrect moves.
	
	With the latest weights, gnu vs. pub is 0.66 ppg.
	
	'The score (after 4000 games) is: gnubg 4430, pubeval 1790
	(money session (without Jacoby rule))'

Mon Feb 28 17:41:54 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* eval.c (CalculateHalfInputs): changed evaluation inputs. see
	comments in code. New net is required, so I changed weights version
	as well.

Sun Feb 20 17:39:07 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* rollout.c (Rollout): Correct standard error calculation; use
	Sam Pottle's recurrence relation to compute variance incrementally.

	* play.c (NextTurn): Avoid blocking SIGINTs entirely.  If NextTurn
	is always called , it can safely check for SIGINTs itself when the
	board is in a consistent state.
	* gnubg.c (NextTurnNotify, main): Always call NextTurn, even if
	interrupted.  NextTurn now exits as soon as possible if an interrupt
	is pending.

	* gnubg.c (main) [!X_DISPLAY_MISSING]: Don't attempt to start X if
	$DISPLAY is not set.

Sat Feb 19 19:27:23 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (main): Call PromptForExit when reading EOF from stdin.

	* gnubg.c (PromptForExit): Set fInterrupt to FALSE.

	* play.c (ComputerTurn, NextTurn): Correct buggy SIGINT processing.
	ComputerTurn should block SIGINTs and test fInterrupt only when
	blocked.  NextTurn should unblock SIGINTs.
	* gnubg.c (ResetInterrupt): Don't unblock SIGINTs; that's
	NextTurn()'s job.

Sat Feb 19 14:27:28 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added TESTS, for "make check" (and "make distcheck").
	* gnubgtest: New file, for self-test.

	* eval.c (EvalInitialise): Add parameter `szDir' to specify
	additional directory to search for weight/bearoff databases.
	All callers changed.
	* gnubg.c (main): Add option `--datadir' (-d).

Fri Feb 18 19:49:35 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* xgame.c (StatsMove): Remove superfluous parameters.  Caller changed.

Thu Feb 17 20:10:10 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* xboard.c (BoardPointer): Fix test of pgd->fDragColour when using
	button 2 or 3 to bear off (this didn't word for red).

	* eval.c (SaveMoves): When fPartial is TRUE, and a later move using
	more pips or moves is found to result in the same position as an
	earlier one (which can happen bearing off the last chequer), update
	the old move.

Wed Feb 16 14:48:16 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* dice.c, set.c [!HAVE_LIBDL]: Add `#if HAVE_LIBDL' conditions to
	some UserRNG calls that were causing problems if libdl was not
	available.
	
	* gnubg.c (GenerateKeywords) [HAVE_LIBREADLINE, X_DISPLAY_MISSING]: Set
 	fReadingOther correctly when using readline but not X.

Wed Feb 16 10:28:51 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* eval.c (FindBestMovePlied): Set a minimum tolerance for ply 0.
	The differences between 1 and 0ply are sometimes large enough so that a
	small tolerance eliminates the better moves.
	Those situations are more likely to happen when different moves are
	evaluated with different neural nets. This is a drawback of using
	several neural nets, and we probably want a better solution in the
	future.

Sun Feb 13 18:28:18 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* eval.c (barPrimeBackGame): fix a serious bug. Some non BPG positions
	are classified as such.

Fri Feb  4 10:00:39 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* set.c (CommandSetDelay): Warn that delays will have no effect
	if "set display" is off.

	rollouts.
	
	* gnubg.c (PortableSignal, PortableSignalRestore): New functions.
	(ShellEscape): New function.  Handle X events while waiting for
	child.

	* play.c (ResetDelayTimer): New function.  Correctly handle
	"set delay" pauses.

	* configure.in, config.h.in: add --with-readline and --with-gdbm
	options.  Try linking with termcap, ncurses or curses for readline.
	
	* backgammon.h: #include <list.h>, even if not using X.

Thu Feb  3 09:36:22 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* play.c (ShowAutoMove): New function.
	(NextTurn): Handle X events while pausing for "set delay".

Wed Feb  2 14:34:22 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* set.c (CommandSetAutoDoubles): Correct output for cAutoDoubles = 0.

Tue Feb  1 21:28:41 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (HandleInputRecursive, GetInput): Ask for confirmation
	before exiting on EOF from stdin, when appropriate.
	(PromptForExit): New function.
	* database.c, gnubg.c, rollout.c: Don't show progress reports
	if stdout isn't a TTY.

Mon Jan 31 21:25:20 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (HandleCommand): Handle "!" as shell escape.

Mon Jan 31 10:43:48 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (ResetInterrupt): New function.
	(ProcessInput): New function.
	(HandleInputRecursive): New function.
	(UserCommand): New function.  Handles non-TTY commands (e.g. input
	from board window), and echos them to TTY.
	(GetInput): New function.  Reads input from TTY below the top level.
	* play.c (NewGame): Abort new game if interrupted during the opening
	roll.
	(ComputerPlayer): Block SIGINTs if anBoard is going to be updated,
	so that the end of the move is atomic.
	(CommandNewGame): Ask "are you sure" if game already in progress.
	
	* dice.c (RollDice): Can now be interrupted (and return error).  All
	callers changed.
	(GetManualDice): Use GetInput to read dice, and return error on
	interrupt.

Thu Jan 27 17:34:45 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c [HAVE_SYS_FILE_H]: #include <sys/file.h> if present, to
	get FASYNC (required on Solaris).

Wed Jan 19 09:59:02 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (HandleIO): Handle X events asynchronously.  Many other
	small related changes.

Mon Jan 17 15:25:14 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (CommandRollout): Label the standard error as such, rather
	than standard deviation (not quite the same thing).

	* rollout.c (VarRednRollout): Do not invert evaluation after calling
	BearoffRollout (BearoffRollout already correctly adjusts for which
	player is on roll).
	(BasicRollout): Add parameter pec to correctly handle cases with
	lookahead but no variance reduction.
	
Sun Jan 16 11:44:10 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (GenerateKeywords, CommandHelp): Don't list commands with
	no help string (e.g. "r", as abbreviation for "roll") in the help
	or completion list.

	* gnubg.c (HandleInput, StdinReadNotify, NextTurnNotify): Fix
	bugs in prompt handling.

Sat Jan 15 19:00:40 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* play.c (NewGame) [!X_DISPLAY_MISSING]: Show board after opening
	roll.

	* play.c, gnubg.c: Reorganised NextTurn() to avoid recursion.
	Code should now call TurnDone() (which will return immediately)
	to schedule the next turn.  This should simplify event handler
	implementation and allow better input handling.
	
	* play.c (CommandRoll): Give error message if it's the computer's
	turn.
	(ComputerTurn): Don't roll the dice when making a take decision.
	(NextTurn): Don't apply fAutoRoll to computer turns.
	
Sat Jan 15 18:04:43 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* database.c, gnubg.c, backgammon.h: Give error message in
	CommandDatabaseRollout if libgdbm is not available.

	* set.c (CommandSetTurn) [!X_DISPLAY_MISSING]: Show board after
	setting turn.

Sat Jan 15 16:56:27 2000  Joseph Heled  <pepe@internet.co.nz>

	* gnubg.c, backgammon.h: add '#if HAVE_LIBGDBM' around
        CommandDatabaseRollout

Fri Jan 14 21:18:37 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* set.c, show.c: Added commands to control rollout parameters.

	* database.c: Renamed CommandDatabaseEvaluate to
	CommandDatabaseRollout.

	* set.c, gnubg.c, eval.c: Added "evalcontext" parameter to
	several evaluation calls.  The settings for each kind of evaluation
	(per player, for rollouts, for "eval" and "hint", etc.) are now
	maintained separately -- e.g. "set player 0 evaluation plies 1",
	"set rollout evaluation tolerance 0.2", "set evaluation candidates 6".

Thu Jan 13 22:20:11 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* drawboard.c (ParseMove): Fixed off-by-one bug in bit mask fl,
	which caused moves like 13/12*/11 to fail (reported by Jared
	Riley).

	* rollout.c (Rollout): Added parameter fVarRedn.
	(BearoffRollout, BasicRollout, VarRednRollout): Old function
	RolloutGame split into 3.

	* show.c (CommandShowAutomatic, CommandShowEvaluation): Show
	current settings.
	* drawboard.c (FormatMovePlain): Reinstate the ugly FormatMove,
	for saving `.mat' files.

	functions.
	* copying.c: New file.

Tue Jan 11 21:42:53 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* play.c (CommandTake): Fix bug when accepting beavers -- the owner
	of the cube after an (eventual) take should be the opponent of the
	_original_ doubler, which is not necessarily the player who finally
	accepted.

	* drawboard.c (ParseMove): New function.
	(FormatMove): Generate prettier output (e.g. "24/13" or "24/18*/13"
	rather than "24/18 18/13").

Mon Jan 10 22:18:55 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* play.c (NextTurn): Don't show the board if fDisplay is not set.

	* rollout.c (RolloutGame): Don't attempt variance reduction when doing
	0-ply evaluations.
	(Rollout): Fix standard deviation calculation (we want the standard
	error in the estimated mean; the code was calculating the population
	standard deviation).
	
Sat Jan  8 23:33:18 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* show.c (CommandShowPipCount): Take an optional position ID parameter.

	* gnubg.c (main): Make --version list optional features supported.
	Use XResourceManagerString instead of requesting property manually.

	* positionid.c (CheckPosition): New function.
	(PositionFromKey, PositionFromID): Fail if the position specified
	is illegal.

	* eval.c (DumpBearoff1): Wrote function.

	* eval.c (SanityCheck): Don't evaluate more backgammons than gammons.

	* gnubg.c: Jacoby rule defaults to off (until we have proper cube
	evaluations).

	* play.c (NextTurn): Partially implemented delay (some problems
	remaining).
	* set.c (CommandSetDelay): New function.

	* set.c (CommandSetCubeUse, CommandSetJacoby): Print warnings if
	the user tries to enable the Jacoby rule and disable cube use.
	
	* gnubg.c (main): add rl_callback_handler_remove to the atexit list.
	
	* xboard.c (BoardPoint, BoardPointer): Allow clicking on the cube to

	* xgame.c (GameHandler): Forward keyboard input in the board window
	on to the window specified by $WINDOWID (if any), so that the user

	is on the board window.

Thu Jan  6 22:07:28 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* makeweights.c: New file.
	* eval.c (EvalInitialise): read binary weights if available.
