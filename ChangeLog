	* gnubg.c (ResetInterrupt): New function.
	(ProcessInput): New function.
	(HandleInputRecursive): New function.
	(UserCommand): New function.  Handles non-TTY commands (e.g. input
	from board window), and echos them to TTY.
	(GetInput): New function.  Reads input from TTY below the top level.
	* play.c (NewGame): Abort new game if interrupted during the opening
	roll.
	(ComputerPlayer): Block SIGINTs if anBoard is going to be updated,
	so that the end of the move is atomic.
	(CommandNewGame): Ask "are you sure" if game already in progress.
	
	* dice.c (RollDice): Can now be interrupted (and return error).  All
	callers changed.

	small related changes.

Mon Jan 17 15:25:14 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* gnubg.c (CommandRollout): Label the standard error as such, rather
	than standard deviation (not quite the same thing).

	* rollout.c (VarRednRollout): Do not invert evaluation after calling
	BearoffRollout (BearoffRollout already correctly adjusts for which
	player is on roll).
	(BasicRollout): Add parameter pec to correctly handle cases with
	lookahead but no variance reduction.
	
Sun Jan 16 11:44:10 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	roll.

	* play.c, gnubg.c: Reorganised NextTurn() to avoid recursion.

	implementation and allow better input handling.
	
	* play.c (CommandRoll): Give error message if it's the computer's
	turn.
	(ComputerTurn): Don't roll the dice when making a take decision.
	(NextTurn): Don't apply fAutoRoll to computer turns.

	* database.c: Renamed CommandDatabaseEvaluate to
	CommandDatabaseRollout.

	* set.c, gnubg.c, eval.c: Added "evalcontext" parameter to

	maintained separately -- e.g. "set player 0 evaluation plies 1",
	"set rollout evaluation tolerance 0.2", "set evaluation candidates 6".

Thu Jan 13 22:20:11 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	(BearoffRollout, BasicRollout, VarRednRollout): Old function
	RolloutGame split into 3.

	* copying.c: New file.

Tue Jan 11 21:42:53 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	of the cube after an (eventual) take should be the opponent of the
	_original_ doubler, which is not necessarily the player who finally

	(FormatMove): Generate prettier output (e.g. "24/13" or "24/18*/13"

	* rollout.c (RolloutGame): Don't attempt variance reduction when doing

	error in the estimated mean; the code was calculating the population
	standard deviation).
	
Sat Jan  8 23:33:18 2000  Gary Wong  <gary@cs.arizona.edu>

	* show.c (CommandShowPipCount): Take an optional position ID parameter.

	* xgame.c (StatsMove): call StatsUpdateBoardID earlier, so that the
	position ID will still be updated even if more than 4 moves are
