Display settings
----------------

* Get all options working...
	* Move non-skin settings to (new 3d) display option page
		+ Only enable when 3d board showing (try disabling page)
		* Make sure options change correctly!
		* Add tooltips for new options
			+ show point labels
	* Update lighting on changes to light paramaters (in preview)
		* Use lighting levels in appearance settings (for colour preveiw - rather than constants)

+ Remove testgtkboard.c file from lib build (and cvs)

Bugs
====

* Add design - doesn't work...

In current version
------------------

* Click on home to move 2 chequers off board when player 0 (human)
	- causes crash or assertion failure
	? Problem in UpdateMove() ?

* Show a colour selection box in appearances
	- strange gtk (General delete case) error on settings exit

* Gtk 1, change colour of 2d design element but cancel colour dialog
	- change not removed until next screen update/change

Other things
============

+ Flag waving (change setting when displayed...)

* Remove rdAppearance from notebook pages - pass in correct ones
	+ So settings saved (not overwritten) when switching 3d<->2d?

Add check for unaccellerated graphics under linux
	+ use glX functions - isDirect()?
	- test

----------------------------------------------------------

Add a few preset light positions
	i.e. left of board, top of board, right of board, centre of board.
On close, remap background to a better shape?
export position png - and any other place that uses rendered board
Show/hide 2d arrow with option

----------------------------------------------------------

FTGL uses C++

Remove any warnings
Check builds and runs without BOARD3D defined (check settings ok too)
Check Gtk1 + 2 ok
