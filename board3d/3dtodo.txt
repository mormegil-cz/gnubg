* Settings not getting applied correctly on startup (gtk 2)

Todo
====

_( before strings?

Add check for unaccellerated graphics under linux
	+ use glX functions - isDirect()?
	- test

+ Flag waving (change setting when displayed...)

+ Remove testgtkboard.c file from lib build (and cvs)

* export position png - and any other place that uses rendered board

Bugs
====

* Sound not always played on exit (2d/no hinges?)

In current version
------------------
* Click on home to move 2 chequers off board when player 0 (human)
	- causes crash or assertion failure
	? Problem in UpdateMove() ?
	* May be fixed - try with latest code

Other things
============

On close, remap background to a better shape?
Show/hide 2d arrow with option

----------------------------------------------------------

FTGL uses C++

Remove any warnings
Check builds and runs without BOARD3D defined (check settings ok too)
Check Gtk1 + 2 ok
