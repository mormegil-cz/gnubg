Ideas
=====

Look at todo...
Is it possible to roll-out bad move/cube decesions when analysing games?
In edit, undo -> go back to board/dice/cube/turn before edit pressed...
Analyse game/match/session -> show statistics once done?
Improve player records

Windows
-------
	Put game record into main screen, with toggle button?
		Similarly annotation window (along bottom)
	Or "modes", playing/analysing/editing...
	Docking windows?

Other things
============

Show/hide 2d arrow with option (after merge)
On close, remap background to a better shape?
