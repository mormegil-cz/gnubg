_( before strings
-----------------
	It's internationalisation (i18n), so you can translate gnubg to your
	preferred language.
	The macro _(...) marks the string for translation, so you should only do it for strings that need it
	commands should not be marked.
	You need to #include "i18n.h" to use _(...).
	Static arrays of strings need special care:
		static char *asz[] = { N_("blah", N_("blah blah") };
	and then
	    printf( _("Blah blah: %s\n"), gettext( asz[ i ] );
