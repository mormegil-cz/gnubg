Todo
====

* Edit board - piece setup not yet done - are there 2 different ways?
	Look at board_quickedit() calls + normal press code

* Right mouse button dragging not working
	No events from gtk - don't know why

* Move string no longer shown
	Put back or move elsewhere...

* Add animation effects
	Animate flag
	Interupt - sort out what happens here
	Blink moves?

* File tidy
	changes - put in #if BOARD3D
	Add if( fX && fDisplay ) where necessary
	remove build warnings

* Roll dice
	* 1st shake of new game, does not work: board (dice) not initialized properly
	Careful setting just dice[0], caused problems when double first shake...

* Change display settings options to allow 3d skin settings
	Merge in with existing 2d settings?
* Add other 3d settings too (new page)

* Swapping 2d<->3d at tricky moments
	Eg. when animating (call stopanimate())
	exit - newgame etc. call stopidle() (n.b. doesn't exit if flag waving :) )
	flag still waves if settings shown when resigning - ok?

* Move textures from data directory to boards or boards/3d

Bugs
====

Strange crash:
	gnubg's go, 
		shake+no go, hangs *when dice area clicked* (just after gnus go)
	(2 g_prints in roll code, seem to have stopped it going wrong...)

Other things
============

1st skin - red pieces look a bit strange (transparancy)

start next game - cube at top, seems to resize at wrong point (after dice roll)
	Reset cube earlier/update viewing volume on update

Merge button press code together

Remove test files from lib build

Remove g_prints/debug code

FTGL uses C++

Check performance
	2d - unaccelerated + at work

Remove initialization code (not needed from lib)
