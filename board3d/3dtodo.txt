GTK problems
============

* Right mouse button dragging not working
- hence can't move piece using right click or edit positions...
	No events from gtk - don't know why

* Double click when editing - 3 extra pieces appear
	Ignore double click

* Interupt animations - sort out what happens here
	+ Testing: try slow animation speed
	Swapping 2d<->3d, showing dialog box etc.

Bugs
----

* Occasionaly hangs on user click, when dice should roll:
	I'm proabably confusing the idle processing - how should this be done properly?
	cpu 100% - stuck in a loop somewhere

* gnubg moving, open appearance dialog (mid animation), change skin number (pause a bit), click ok -> crash
	Stop animation when interupted - fixes this problem?
	Similiarly: flag still waves if settings shown when resigning - ok?

* Fails to load (run) on my windows 98 box

Todo
====

* Add animation effects
	Blink moves?

Display setting
---------------

	* Change display settings options to allow 3d skin settings
		Merge in with existing 2d settings?
	* Add other 3d settings too (new page)

	Design/think about this bit.

Other things
============

1st skin - red pieces look a bit strange (transparancy)

Merge button press code together
	Split up big function at same time
	Use separate messages too

Move textures from data directory to boards or boards/3d
	Add to cvs

Change win32 messagebox's to gtk messagebox's

FTGL uses C++

Check performance
	2d + unaccelerated

Remove g_prints/debug code

Remove test files from lib build

Remove initialization code (not needed from lib) - when in settings

remove build warnings

remove pCurBoard and use bd passed in throughout (or as much as poss)?

Check display calls - minimium number
