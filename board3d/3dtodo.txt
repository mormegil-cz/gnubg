Other things
============

board angle/fov
	Only calculate when they change (use cached values in glFrustrum)
	Look at deriving fov angle from board angle/aspect to set zoom to consistient value
		i.e. fix viewing distance - check board looks good at various angles
	Workout/guess/iterate FOV angle calculation

Tidy files
	remove pCurBoard and use bd passed in throughout (or as much as poss)?

	Look at base_unit usage
		Vary board sizes + check things are ok
	Merge button press code together
		Split up big function at same time
		Use separate messages too
	Put animation effects in misc3d.c to a new file
		+ Add stuff in widget.c too (or put animation stuff here)
