Bugs
====

* Play 2 moves each, go back to your last move in game record window, then resign the game
 -> strange piece movement before resignation.
	+ Doesn't work in 2d or 3d view
	
* 2d view: resign game, new game starts and resignation cube still visible.
	+ Now switch to 3d view and sometimes hangs... or "no dice?" message

+Both go wrong with BOARD3D not defined

Other things
============

Tidy files
	Put animation effects in misc3d.c to a new file/check through files
		+ Add stuff in widget.c too (or put animation stuff here)
	Remove test files from lib build (testgtkboard.c)
		+ Remove initialization code (not needed from lib) - when in settings
	Sort out dice_roll/dice/dice_opponent rubbish
		+ No dice showing/dice below board or on either side

Accelerated check
	Add proper accelerated check under windows
	Add check for unaccellerated graphics under linux
		+ build/use very simple example to test

Add tooltips for new options

----------------------------------------------------------

Add a few preset light positions
	i.e. left of board, top of board, right of board, centre of board.

Move texture location from data directory to boards or boards/3d or boards/textures
	Add them to cvs (as binary files)

----------------------------------------------------------

export position png - render 3d board to file?
Separate dice animation speed setting?
Add gtk 1.3 option (via other gtk widget)
	+ Test ok
Blink move animatation - useful?
FTGL uses C++
