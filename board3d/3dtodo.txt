Display settings
----------------
	* Change display settings options to allow 3d skin settings
		Merge in with existing 2d settings?
	* Add other 3d settings too
		Add tooltips
		+ Look at slidetest.c

	Design/think about this bit.

Bugs
====

Possible targets - texture interferes in 2nd+3rd skin

Only wave flag if playing
	+ Resign (lose) - show options and flag starts waving again...

Remove g_prints/debug code

Add gtk 1.3 option (via other gtk widget)
