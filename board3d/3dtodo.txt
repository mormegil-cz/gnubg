Display settings
----------------
	* Change display settings options to allow 3d skin settings
		Merge in with existing 2d settings?
		(Look at materials.h for sample colour settings)

	? Merge options/display and appearance/general+3d together?
		Some of the options/display seem out of place
		animation speed/type + dice below board

	Setting appearance/general messy
		Change bottom bits to 2d settings / or add a light setting tab?

	* Change skin options to be similiar to windows selection?
		i.e. two pages, one to select the skin and the other to vary settings
		select items from drop down - or click on the screen

	Add apply button to appearance dialog?
