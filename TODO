People's names next to entries in this file mean they intend to work on that
item soon.  Please contact them before working on related areas, to avoid
duplication of effort and to make sure our changes merge easily.

* Evaluations:
** Allow different settings (e.g. search ply, candidates, tolerance) for each
  position class.
** Add more evaluation classes.
*** Add a neural net to correct errors in BEAROFF1 class.
*** Classes for bearing off against contact, back games, containment
  positions, prime-vs-prime...
*** Consider meta-pi scheme for using output from multiple nets.
** See http://www.oasya.com/CubefulAdvantages.html for example of
  cubeful evaluation.
** Improve quasi-random dice generation for rollouts. (gary)
** Create multiple threads to parallelise rollouts (and evaluations?) on
  multiprocessors.  Perhaps start remote processes?

* Game play:
** Add cube handling for computer player.  See tag "thyssen-double-branch"
  in the CVS repository for work on this.

* Command interface:
** Check "show" exists for every "set"!
** Add more completions to help and readline.
** Allow timeouts for "train" (and others?).
** Add interactive rollouts.
** Load, save and analyse games and matches.
** Finish saving positions and evaluations to databases.
** Finish supervised training, and allow people to submit training data via
  web.
** Make sure input behaves correctly when stdin is not a TTY. (gary)
** Write fancy output routines (to replace printf, puts, etc.) that wraps
  words and pauses before scrolling (as in gdb).
** Extend FormatMove() and ParseMove() to handle abbreviation of
  multiple moves (e.g. "8/7(2) 6/5(2)").  Make FormatMovePlain()
  use the old ugly format for JF compatibility (25 not bar, 0 not off.
  * for hits is OK).
** Finish "help" -- add detailed help for each command.
** Add undo, reroll, and viewing next/prev moves in game/match.  (Reroll
  is not really necessary, since "set turn <player>" will let them roll
  again.)
** Allow reading commands from scripts.  A .gnubgrc file would contain
  startup commands.  This needs some thought to make sure it works well
  with Guile scripts.
** Add ":" as a Guile escape, once it's here.
** When "set board" is given with no parameters under X, set it to the
  current position displayed in the board window.  (Perhaps a button in
  the board window would be better.)
** Allow resuming interrupted rollouts.
** Save partial input when TTY input is overwritten by an X command.
  The best way would be to unify what GetInput does and ProcessInput,
  with push/pop semantics for readline state. (gary)

* X interface:
** Get rid of Xmu calls in ext (they're not really portable). (gary)
** Add a board edit mode.  What would be the best semantics for the
  interface?
** Add a game window, which lists the moves made in the game so far and
  allows moving back and forth.
** Don't flood the server with requests (which can happen if gnubg is
  playing itself at ply 0).  Wait until the server has finished the
  previous ShowBoard before sending a new one; boards in the meantime
  can be silently discarded.  What does xterm do to implement jump
  scrolling?
** Allow clicking on a point to make that point.
** Use the MBX (multi buffering) and SHM (shared memory) extensions in the
  board window, if available.
** Add GTK support.
*** Make sure the board window behaves properly with ICCCM things.
*** Allow copy/paste and drag & drop of the board ID in the board window.
*** Add silly bells and whistles.  Things like colour selector for chequer
  colours, angle of light, surface of pieces, transparent background, etc.
*** Add menus and dialogs so that games can be played without the
  terminal window at all.

* Bugs:
** EvaluatePositionCache should store more information in the evalcache
  struct, to make sure that cache entries for the same position with
  different cube values or evaluation parameters don't collide.
** Nothing handles running out of memory gracefully.  A solution
  could be to write a malloc() wrapper that (if malloc fails) first
  tries to free memory (e.g. flush the eval cache); if malloc still
  doesn't succeed, then print an error message and longjmp() to the
  main loop.  When using the GNU C library, __malloc_hook can be used
  too (so we can intercept calls coming from Xlib, for instance).  We
  shouldn't longjmp() out of the hook, though (it might confuse library
  functions).
** If the exposed area in BoardRedraw() intersects a point but not the
  dice, the point will be redrawn -- but sometimes that will overwrite
  the dice, which then need updating.

* Documentation:
** Complete the Texinfo manual.  Perhaps for now, only things that are
  unlikely to change should be documented.
** Describe the ASCII vs. binary weights behaviour.

* Miscellaneous:
** Add internationalisation (gettext).
** Add more to http://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/... -- definitely the
  HTML formatted manual, and perhaps pages to submit training data,
  an online evaluator like Monte Carlo, maybe even an entire game like
  Motif.
** Submit something to <http://www.distributed.net/nextgen/projects.html>.
** Allow loading and saving weights to specify binary or ASCII format.
** Allow annotating moves in matches.  It would be nice to be compatible
  with other formats (Snowie?  CBG?) but these are probably undocumented.
  The SGF format (Smart Game Format -- see <http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/>)
  can probably be extended to backgammon, instead.
** Export matches (and analysis) to ASCII, HTML, PostScript, etc.
** Import and export position databases to a portable format.
** Add option to flip the board.
** Find someone who lives near London and wants to enter gnubg in the
  MSO Olympiad in August: <http://www.msoworld.com/Olympiad/computer.html>.
