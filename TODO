People's names next to entries in this file mean they intend to work on that
item soon.  Please contact them before working on related areas, to avoid
duplication of effort and to make sure our changes merge easily.

* Evaluations:
** Allow different settings (e.g. search ply, candidates, tolerance) for each
  position class. Also allow different settings for cube action.
** Add more evaluation classes.
*** Add a neural net to correct errors in BEAROFF1 class.
*** Classes for bearing off against contact, back games, containment
  positions, prime-vs-prime...
*** Consider meta-pi scheme for using output from multiple nets.
** See http://www.oasya.com/CubefulAdvantages.html for example of
  cubeful evaluation. The current money game code can do cubeful
  evaluations (currently only used for cube action) but it should be
  easy to write code for cubeful checkerplay (i.e. let FindBestMove call
  EvaluatePositionCubeful instead of EvaluatePosition). For cubeful
  checkerplay there should probably be a rScore2 field with the
  cubeless equity which, when two
  moves give (exactly) the same equity, is used as score (e.g. when
  two moves both are so bad that the opponent should double, and we 
  should pass, both moves have cubeful equity -1. But the opponent
  might not double, in which case it had been best to choose the
  move with highest cubeless equity. (thyssen) (this looks like it's done
  already)
** Add another "eval"-like command that show the distribution of
  equities n rolls ahead.  SW does bar graphs of this stuff; Cam Trenor
  suggests alternative output.
** Improve quasi-random dice generation for rollouts. (gary)
** Create multiple threads to parallelise rollouts (and evaluations?) on
  multiprocessors.  Perhaps start remote processes?
** Add more statistics for rollouts (e.g. number of times each player hit,
  number of turns on the bar, whether each player is closed out, average
  number of pips wasted bearing off, etc.)
** Add cubeful rollouts
** Make gnubg offer resignations when its position is hopeless.
** EvaluatePositionCache doesn't currently cache evaluations deeper than
  0-ply for match play.  Update EvalCacheHash so that spurious collisions
  won't occur, and then change EvaluatePositionCache to cache what it can.
** Bearoff database changes:
*** Use a more intelligent encoding in the 1-sided database, to conserve
  space.
*** Joseph notes the 1-sided bearoff database is nearly as good as the
  2-sided.  Add an option to omit the 2-sided one, to conserve disk
  and memory space.  (And time to generate them -- on a 330MHz Pentium II,
  it takes 3 minutes to generate the 1-sided database and 20 for the
  2-sided.)

* Commands:
** Add more completions to readline (player names, filenames for load/save).
** Allow timeouts for "train" (and others?).
** Add interactive rollouts.
** Analyse games and matches.
** Finish saving positions and evaluations to databases.
** Finish supervised training, and allow people to submit training data via
  web.
** Make sure input behaves correctly when stdin is not a TTY (the only
  problems seem to be cosmetic; junk is echoed to stdout). (gary)
** Make output*() functions wrap words, and pause before scrolling (as in
  gdb).  Make sure output to stderr is available when using GTK -- perror
  calls will have to be replaced, for instance.
** Extend FormatMove() and ParseMove() to handle abbreviation of
  multiple moves (e.g. "8/7(2) 6/5(2)").
** Allow resuming interrupted rollouts.
** Save partial input when TTY input is overwritten by an X command.
  The best way would be to unify what GetInput does and ProcessInput,
  with push/pop semantics for readline state. (gary)
** Change "set beavers" to allow a limit on the number of beavers
  permitted.
** Add a "set record" command; when "record" is off, no moves are
  recorded (which implies that "save", "list" and the game list window
  won't work, but it will save memory for situations like playing
  10,000 games vs. pubeval).
** Add a command "show moves" which shows a list of legal moves, like hint
  does, but without evaluating them.
** Also "add move", to add a specific move to the list (e.g.
  "add move 8/5 6/5").
** Once we have cubeful rollouts, allow the command "rollout =cube"
  to perform a rollout to judge cube decisions (under GTK, there should
  be a "Rollout" button in the hint window for cube decisions, and something
  under the Analyse menu).
** Make "show marketwindow" say something for money games.

* Guile:
** Add more data types and Scheme bindings for useful functions.
** Define Scheme "port"s for the gnubg output() functions.
** Defer and allow Guile interrupts at appropriate places in guile.c.
  (For instance, evaluating "(define (x) (x)) (x)" in Guile can be
  interrupted.  But "(rollout-position (current-board))" cannot.) (gary)
** Use Guile keywords in cube-info.  Add a similar function for eval
  contexts.
** Add Guile functions to access the current game state.

* TTY interface:
** Display the score and match length in ShowBoard().
** Handle "list game" and "list match".

* X interface:
** Does anybody still use the old Xlib (Ext) interface any more?  If so,
  perhaps they are interested in maintaining it.  If not, maybe it should
  be deprecated and eventually removed (all the recent GUI effort has
  concentrated on the GTK interface anyway).

* GTK interface:
** Allow copy/paste and drag & drop of the board ID in the board window.
** Finish menus (settings, in particular).  Make sure there is a GUI
  equivalent for every command.
** Add a prompt and entry field to allow commands to be entered (replacing
  stdin).
** Allow the user to decide whether short messages appear in dialogs
  instead of the status bar, or whether all messages are appended to a
  message window.
** Disable the reset/edit buttons in the board window when no game is in
  progress.  (Disable appropriate menu items, too.)  Disable the "stop"
  button when nothing is happening.
** Add optional point number labels on the board.
** Add "beavers" in the Set menu.
** Have a progress bar along with some text in the main window, which
   indicates progress for the current possibly time-consuming operation.
   E.g. when the user clicks 'hint' the progress text will show
   "finding best moves..." and the progress bar will indicate how far
   gnubg is in the process. This could/should be implemented for
   "evaluation", "hint", when gnubg is considering cube action,
   when gnubg is searching for it's best move etc.
** Left mouse moves checker left-die, the two dice then interchanges,
  and the user can now move the other die. If the user clicks a
  checker that cannot be moved with the left die, it should move the 
  checker with the right die if possible [this is analogous to the
  behaviour in Snowie].
** Add progress indicators for everything that checks fShowProgress.
  A function that generates a progress bar/ASCII to stdout would help.
** Show "take" and "drop" buttons in the off-board dice window when
  a double is offered; also "agree" and "decline" for resignations.
** Make sure we apply GTK styles correctly: create a GtkRcStyle; set the
  background colour in the style and the flag indicating the background is
  set; call gtk_widget_modify_style; unref the style.  This makes sure the
  style will survive across theme changes.
** Make usage() show the GDK and GTK options, if appropriate.
** Make load/save and prev game/next game freeze and thaw the game list;
  load match shouldn't update the score between games, either. (gary)
** When the user is moving, show _complete_ moves differently from
  incomplete ones.
** Add commands to _hide_ the game window ("list game" shows it).
  Should we show it by default?
** Animate the chequers when the computer moves.
** Show a preview of the chequers in the appearances dialog.
** Allow the border colour to be changed, and honour the user's lighting
  angle when rendering the border.
** Make "next" and "previous" change the off-board dice (see
  game_set_old_dice()).

** Dialogs:
*** Make "help" show its output in a CList (CTree?).  The user must be able
  to recurse through help for subcommands.
*** Make "show matchequitytable" show output in a table.
*** Allow selection of data from the rollout dialog (see the hint dialog for
  an example). (gary)
*** Make the rollout dialog look more like the hint dialog. (gary)

* Bugs:
** Nothing handles running out of memory gracefully.  A solution
  could be to write a malloc() wrapper that (if malloc fails) first
  tries to free memory (e.g. flush the eval cache); if malloc still
  doesn't succeed, then print an error message and longjmp() to the
  main loop.  When using the GNU C library, __malloc_hook can be used
  too (so we can intercept calls coming from Xlib, for instance).  We
  shouldn't longjmp() out of the hook, though (it might confuse library
  functions).
** The erroneous commands "set player both" and "set player both evaluation"
  give poor error messages; "set score -1 -1" gives a bad message too (it
  should be redefined to set 1-away, 1-away).
** The GTK code uses ConnectionNumber() at various places to detect X
  events.  This is unportable and ugly; find something better. (gary)
** "set player <tab>" gives incorrect completions.
** When using GTK, some output is lost for (e.g.) "set player both human".
  It should show in a dialog, not in the status bar.
** Cosmetic problems when a "set board" is shown in the game list (the
  wrong cell is highlighted).
** When using guile and guile isn't using readline, X events are not
  handled while in the REPL.  When using guile and guile _is_ using
  readline, its readline state and ours get completely confused...
  see what the REPL in guile-gtk does.
** "set eval cubeful" gives a poor error message.
** Cosmetic bug when using the rollout button in the hint window (the
  commands echoed to stdout and the prompts are in the wrong order).
** Changing a player's name doesn't affect the names in the drop-down
  menu in the game window.
** The SGF loading (saving?) routines don't abort on interrupt.
  "load commands /dev/zero" aborts on a TTY interrupt, but not the
  GTK `stop' button.

* Documentation:
** Complete the Texinfo manual.  Perhaps for now, only things that are
  unlikely to change should be documented.

* Miscellaneous:
** Add internationalisation (gettext).
** Add more to http://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/... -- perhaps pages to
  submit training data, an online evaluator like Monte Carlo, maybe even an
  entire game like Motif.
** Submit something to <http://www.distributed.net/nextgen/projects.html>.
** Allow loading and saving weights to specify binary or ASCII format.
** Allow annotating moves in matches (both human commentary and automatic
  analysis).
** Import FIBS `oldmoves' games and matches.
** Export games, matches and analysis to ASCII, HTML, PostScript, etc.
  Examples: "export game html foo.html", "export match mat bar.mat".
  Make the .mat format identical to Jellyfish (things to check:
  beavers, resignations, "and the match"...)
** Import and export position databases to a portable format.
** Add option to flip the board.
** Think about generating huge databases for CD-ROMs (we can get 1-sided
  databases for all chequers up to the 11 point, or 2-sided databases where
  both players have up to 11 chequers in the home board onto a CD-ROM).
** Add optional time rules, for tournament play when clocks are used.
** Add more optional feature tests to "make check" -- databases, X?
** Change the fConfirm ("are you sure you want to abort the game in
  progress") checks so that they _do_ ask when the game is over but the
  match is still in progress, and they _don't_ ask if a game has not been
  modified since it was last loaded/saved.
** Change the `no-weights' option to `new-weights', and allow specification
  of the net size (e.g. "gnubg -new-weights=128").  Add an equivalent
  command "new weights".
** Extend ParsePosition to cope with other formats, e.g. FIBS
  "boardstyle 3" and/or a human friendly position description,
  like "set board 0 -1 2 -2 2 -3 -4 -2 -3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 1 0 0".
** Do more in CommandSaveSettings.
** Handle SGF setup properties when loading games.
** Make "eval" pay attention to the percentage/probability settings. (gary)
** Add an "external" player (writes boards/reads moves to/from a Unix
  domain socket).
