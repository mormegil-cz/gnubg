GNU Backgammon 0.12
===================

This is a pre-release version of GNU Backgammon (gnubg), a backgammon
player and analysis tool.  Please send comments and suggestions to
<bug-gnubg@gnu.org>.

Look for news and upcoming releases of GNU Backgammon at:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/gnubg.html

For instructions on how to build gnubg, please read the file `INSTALL'
and the other sections in this file; for other information, please see
the GNU Backgammon manual in the `doc' directory.

Current features:
-----------------

 - A 2-sided bearoff database which gives perfect cubeless evaluations
   for all positions where both players have 6 chequers or less remaining
 - A 1-sided bearoff database which gives accurate cubeless evaluations
   for all other bearoff positions
 - Neural net functions for giving cubeless evaluations of all other
   contact and race positions
 - Functions to generate legal moves and evaluate positions at varying
   search depths
 - Tournament match and money session cube handling
 - A command line interface (with full command editing features if GNU
   readline is available) that lets you play matches and sessions against
   gnubg
 - Support for either a GTK+ interface with a graphical board window, or
   a rough ASCII representation of a board on text terminals
 - Automated rollouts of positions, with lookahead and race variance
   reduction where appropriate
 - Both TD(0) and supervised training of neural net weights
 - Position databases for supervised training (if GNU dbm is available)
 - Loading and saving .sgf games and matches (.sgf files are in the
   Smart Game Format)
 - Exporting games and matches to .mat, LaTeX, PostScript and PDF formats
 - Importing .pos, .mat, .sgg and FIBS "oldmoves" files
 - Scripting ability (if GNU Guile is available)
 - Automatic and manual annotation (analysis and commentary) of games and
   matches

The file `gnubg.bd':
--------------------

  GNU Backgammon is designed to work with a file containing a database
of endgame positions, to evaluate moves during the bearoff.  This file
is several megabytes large, and is slow to generate, so is not
included with the distribution.  The "make" process will warn you if
the database is not found during compilation.  If you see this
warning, you have three options:

  1) Ignore the database file.  You can run gnubg without the full
     database, and it will generate a small approximate bearoff table
     in-memory when you run it.  However, its evaluation of bearoff
     moves will be slightly weaker.

  2) Generate the file yourself.  You can do this with the command
     "make bearoff-database".  This procedure might take half an hour
     or more, depending on the speed of your computer.

  3) Obtain a copy of the database from the Internet.  It is available
     by FTP from:

        ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/gnubg.bd.gz

     Make sure you decompress the file (with gunzip) once you have
     retrieved it, and move it to the directory containing this README
     file.

The files `gnubg.weights' and `gnubg.wd':
-----------------------------------------

  The weights for gnubg's neural nets are stored in the files
`gnubg.weights' and `gnubg.wd'.  `gnubg.weights' is in ASCII format,
while `gnubg.wd' is a binary file.  However, both contain the same
information; you only need one of the two.  The advantage of
`gnubg.weights' is that it is platform independent; the advantage of
`gnubg.wd' is that it is somewhat smaller and much faster to load.
The build procedure will automatically generate `gnubg.wd' from
`gnubg.weights', if you have it.

  Although it is possible to run GNU Backgammon without a neural net
weight file at all (it will generate random weights), we recommend
that you obtain pre-trained weights; a file compatible with this
pre-release is available at:

        ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnubg/gnubg.weights-0.11.gz

Make sure you decompress the file (with gunzip) and rename it to
`gnubg.weights' in the same directory as this README file.


Thanks for trying GNU Backgammon!
